# Model Card

## Model Details
The model is a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Census Income Dataset to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on various demographic and work-related attributes. The model leverages scikit-learn's implementation of Random Forest with default hyperparameters. Key features include categorical variables like workclass, education, and marital status, which were processed using one-hot encoding.

## Intended Use

The model is intended for educational and demonstration purposes. It showcases the process of data preprocessing, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance. The model should not be used for real-world decision-making or policy enforcement due to potential biases in the data and limited validation.

## Training Data

The training data is a subset of the Census Income Dataset, which contains demographic and work-related information for individuals. The data includes attributes such as age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, hours worked per week, and native country, along with the target label indicating income (above or below $50,000).

Size of training data: 75% of the full dataset after splitting.

Preprocessing: One-hot encoding was applied to categorical features, and label binarization was used for the target variable.

## Evaluation Data

The evaluation data is the remaining 25% of the Census Income Dataset, held out during training. It was processed in the same way as the training data.

Size of evaluation data: 25% of the full dataset.

Purpose: Used to measure the model’s performance and assess its ability to generalize to unseen data.

## Metrics

The following metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance:

Precision: 0.75

Recall: 0.64

F1 Score: 0.69

These metrics were calculated on the evaluation data using scikit-learn’s precision, recall, and fbeta_score functions.


## Ethical Considerations

The model is trained on a dataset that may contain historical biases, especially regarding sensitive attributes like race, sex, and native country. These biases can affect the model’s predictions and lead to unfair outcomes. Users should be cautious when interpreting results and avoid deploying the model in real-world scenarios without thorough fairness audits.

The model does not consider the societal implications of predicting income levels, which could reinforce stereotypes or inequalities.


## Caveats and Recommendations

The model’s performance is limited by the quality and representativeness of the training data.

The metrics indicate good performance on the evaluation data but may not generalize to other datasets.

Users should validate the model thoroughly if used for purposes beyond education or demonstration.

Sensitive attributes should be handled carefully to ensure fairness and minimize bias in predictions.

In summary, this model serves as a demonstration of machine learning workflows and should be used responsibly, keeping in mind its limitations and ethical implications.
